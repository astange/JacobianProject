To run my code, simply click on the Jacobian.jar. This will open an application that you can use to switch between the sorting and non-sorting methods and every time you run either method it will generate a new random matrix.

To compile my code, put all .java files into your favorite IDE and link the jama.jar to the build path and everything should work fine.
